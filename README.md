# Network-IDS-ML

The repository focuses on building a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using machine learning techniques. It provides a structured approach to detecting malicious activities in network traffic by training models on labeled datasets. Key files include Jupyter notebooks showcasing the implementation, and CSV files containing training and testing data. This project aims to enhance network security by automating the detection of anomalies or intrusions, making it a valuable resource for cybersecurity applications.
